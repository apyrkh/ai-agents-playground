# AI Agents Playground

## Agentic AI Demo

This project showcases a lightweight multi-agent setup for structured information extraction and AI use-case generation from natural language inputs.  
Agents parse the user request, identify key intents, work with prepared or mock data, and produce a structured output — from quick wins to strategic bets.

The demo is designed to illustrate the capabilities of an agentic approach without heavy infrastructure (no RAG, no vector DB, etc.).
